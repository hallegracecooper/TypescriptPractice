# Overview

As a software engineer looking to deepen my understanding of TypeScript, I developed the **Directory Scanner Project**, which demonstrates several TypeScript features such as recursion, asynchronous operations, classes, and error handling. This project simulates directory scanning, listing files, and handling asynchronous operations like fetching data.

My goal is to showcase how TypeScript handles these features, and also to practice writing clean, maintainable code with proper error handling and testing.

# Development Environment

- **Programming Language**: TypeScript
- **Libraries**: 
  - Jest (for testing)
  - Node.js (runtime environment)
- **Development Tools**: 
  - Visual Studio Code
  - TypeScript Compiler (tsc)
  - TSLint (for linting)

# Features

- **Recursive Directory Scanning**: The program recursively scans directories to list their contents.
- **Asynchronous Functions**: Demonstrates `async/await` functionality to simulate data fetching.
- **Error Handling**: Uses `try...catch` blocks to handle errors that may occur during directory scanning.
- **Unit Testing**: Includes tests for recursive functions and asynchronous behavior using Jest.

- [Jest Testing Framework](https://jestjs.io/docs)
- [Node.js Documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/)

# Future Work

- **Improve Error Handling**: Add more specific error messages and handle other edge cases.
- **Optimize Recursion**: Implement a more efficient recursion strategy to handle large directories.
- **Add Additional Features**: Allow users to perform operations on scanned files, such as reading or deleting.
